## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing business performance using the Superstore dataset by integrating SQL-based data modeling, Python-driven exploratory data analysis, machine learning.
The goal is to derive actionable insights related to sales trends, customer behavior, profitability, and future performance to support data-driven business decision-making.

The project simulates real-world data science and analytics tasks typically handled during data analyst or data science internships.

## Key Findings & Business Insights

* Identified categories and sub-categories contributing the highest and lowest profit margins
* Analyzed the impact of discounts on profitability and identified loss-making discount ranges
* Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior to identify high-value customers
* Detected products consistently generating losses despite high sales volume
* Forecasted short-term sales trends to support planning and inventory decisions
